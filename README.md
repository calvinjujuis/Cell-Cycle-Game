# Conway's Game of Life 

*A C++ command-line game that resembles The Game of Life by John Conway.*


## Rules from The Game of Life:

> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
> 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
> 3. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
